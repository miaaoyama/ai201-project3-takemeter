# Classifier Spec — Pod Classifier

Complete this spec **before** writing any code for Milestone 2.

Use Plan or Ask mode to think through each blank field. When you're done,
your answers here become the blueprint for `build_few_shot_prompt()` and
`classify_episode()` in `classifier.py`.

---

## build_few_shot_prompt(labeled_examples, description)

### What it does
Constructs a prompt string for the LLM that includes the task instructions,
all labeled training examples, and the new episode description to classify.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `labeled_examples` | `list[dict]` | Each dict has `"title"`, `"description"`, `"label"` (and others). These are the examples you labeled in Milestone 1. |
| `description` | `str` | The episode description to classify. |

### Output

| Return value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| prompt | `str` | A complete prompt string ready to send to the LLM. |

### Spec fields — fill these in before writing code

**Task instruction (what should the LLM know about the task?):**

```
You are classifying podcast episodes by their format. Classify the episode
into exactly one of these four labels:

- interview: a conversation between a host and one or more guests
- solo: a single host speaking from memory, experience, or opinion — no guests,
  no assembled external sources
- panel: multiple guests with roughly equal speaking time, often debating or
  discussing a topic together
- narrative: a story assembled from external sources — interviews, archival
  audio, reporting — with a clear narrative arc

Return only the label and your reasoning. Do not explain the taxonomy.
```

---

**How should labeled examples be formatted in the prompt?**

```
Each example should include the episode title, a brief excerpt or the full
description, and the correct label. Separate examples with a blank line or
a delimiter like "---". Include all fields that help the model see why the
label was applied — title and description are both useful; other fields
(like episode ID) are not needed.
```

---

**Example block sketch (write one concrete example):**

```
Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Label: {label}
```

---

**How should the new episode (to be classified) be presented?**

```
Present it in the same format as the labeled examples, but omit the Label
line and replace it with an instruction to classify. For example:

Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Label: ?

Then add a line like: "Classify the episode above. Return your answer in
the format below:" followed by the output format you chose.
```

---

**What output format should you request from the LLM?**

I will request a two-line structured text format:

LABEL: <interview | solo | panel | narrative>
REASONING: <brief explanation>

I chose this instead of JSON because it is easier for the LLM to follow and easier for my code to parse with simple string operations. JSON is more structured, but it can break if the model adds extra text or invalid formatting. A label-only response would be easiest to parse, but it would not give reasoning for debugging. The LABEL/REASONING format gives both reliable parsing and useful explanation.

---

**Edge cases to handle in the prompt:**

If labeled_examples is empty, the prompt should still include the taxonomy definitions and ask the model to classify using those definitions, but it will not include example blocks. If the description is very short, the prompt should tell the model to make the best classification based on the available format clues and return "unknown" only if the format cannot be determined.

---

## classify_episode(description, labeled_examples)

### What it does
Classifies a single podcast episode description using the few-shot LLM classifier.
Returns a dict with a label and reasoning.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | `str` | The episode description to classify. |
| `labeled_examples` | `list[dict]` | Labeled training examples from `load_labeled_examples()`. |

### Output

| Return value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| result | `dict` | Must have keys `"label"` and `"reasoning"`. `"label"` must be one of `VALID_LABELS` or `"unknown"`. |

---

### Spec fields — fill these in before writing code

**Step 1 — Build the prompt:**

```
Call build_few_shot_prompt(labeled_examples, description) and store the
returned string in a variable (e.g., prompt). Pass through both arguments
exactly as received — no modification needed before calling.
```

---

**Step 2 — Send to the LLM:**

```
Call _client.chat.completions.create() with:
  - model: the model name from config (LLM_MODEL)
  - messages: a list with one dict — {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    (system-design.md shows an optional system message too — either shape works)
  - max_tokens: a reasonable limit (e.g., 200–300) to keep responses concise

Extract the response text from:
  response.choices[0].message.content
```

---

**Step 3 — Parse the response:**

Because I chose the LABEL/REASONING format, I will split the LLM response into lines. I will look for a line that starts with "LABEL:" and extract the text after the colon. I will normalize that label by stripping whitespace, removing extra punctuation or markdown if needed, and converting it to lowercase.

For reasoning, I will look for a line that starts with "REASONING:" and extract the text after the colon. If there is no reasoning line, I will use the full raw response as the reasoning so I can debug what happened.

---

**Step 4 — Validate the label:**

After parsing and normalizing the label, I will check whether it is in VALID_LABELS. If it is valid, I will return it. If it is not in VALID_LABELS, I will set the label to "unknown" and include the raw LLM response in the reasoning so the issue can be inspected later.

---

**Step 5 — Handle errors gracefully:**

Things that could go wrong include an API/network error, an empty LLM response, a response that does not follow the requested format, or a label that is not in VALID_LABELS. The function should catch exceptions and return {"label": "unknown", "reasoning": "..."} instead of crashing. This way, one bad response will not stop the full evaluation loop.

---

### Return value structure

```python
{
    "label": str,      # one of VALID_LABELS, or "unknown" if invalid/error
    "reasoning": str,  # brief explanation from the LLM
}
```

---

## Notes on label quality

The classifier is only as good as your labels. If your training examples have
inconsistent or ambiguous labels, the LLM will learn the wrong pattern.

Before implementing the classifier, re-read `data/taxonomy.md` and double-check
any labels you're unsure about. Annotation quality is part of the lab.

## Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and testing both functions.*

**Test: what does the raw LLM response look like for one episode?**

```
Episode tested: [title]
Raw response text: [paste it here]
```

**How did you parse the label out of the response?**

```
[describe the string operations — strip, split, lower, etc.]
```

**Did any episodes return `"unknown"`? If so, why?**

```
[yes / no — if yes, what did the raw response look like?]
```

**One thing about the output format that surprised you:**

```
